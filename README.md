# audiostitcher
A streamlit app that lets you download, speed up/slow down, and loop audio segments from YouTube. I use this when learning new guitar licks to adjust the tempo of tricky bits and loop them for practice.

# Setup
This has been (minimally) tested on OSX. Caveat emptor.

1. `brew install ffmpeg`
2. `brew install rubberband`
3. `git clone https://github.com/bradshawben/audiostitcher.git`
4. `cd audiostitcher`
5. `pip install -r requirements.txt`
6. `streamlit run audiostitcher.py`
